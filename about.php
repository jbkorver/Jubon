          <h3>The Product</h3>
          Jubon was created to give small towns a vehicle for an online presence and a way to organize 
          the communities web pages.  It gives each
            town a visual overview or map like the one you see to the right. The maps contain landmarks, parks, and businesses (to name a few). 
          <p>By clicking on the 
            map, users can control the movements of the  little car we call the Jubon 8 <img src="img/car12.png"/>.  If the Jubon 8
            stops in front of a business on the map, information for that business will be displayed.
          </p>
             If it stops in front of a landmark or park, you will see an image of that object. If a popup window is showing with information about a business or an image of a landmark, you can either click on the <img src="img/icon_close.png"/> in the upper right hand corner of the popup window, or you can simply click on a new location that you would like the Jubon 8 to visit.  As the Jubon 8 drives to the new location, any popup windows that are currently showing will be closed automatically.</p>
             <p>If you would like to see what an icon on the map refers to, move your mouse over that 
             icon and you will see what the business or landmark is without having to drive to it.  If
             you click on the icon, you will see the popup window with the appropriate information.  
             This is the same information that will be displayed if you drive the Jubon 8 to the 
             location.
